# Tic-Tac-Toe tech test

## Requirements

* Your goal is to write a program that lets two humans play Tic-Tac-Toe against each other.
* Implement a command line interface that lets the humans play the game by typing commands into the terminal.
* Players should be able to input their moves.
* The board should be shown after each move.
* The game should announce the result of the game when it's over.

### Rules of Tic-Tac-Toe

* There are two players in the game (X and O).
* The board is 9 squares in a 3x3 grid.
* Players take turns until the game is over.
* A player can claim a square if it is not already taken.
* A turn ends when a player claims a square.
* A player wins if they make a line by claiming 3 squares in a row, 3 squares in a column, or 3 squares in a diagonal.
* If all squares are taken and neither player has a line, the game is a draw.
